## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

### Welcome to my GitHub account!
I'm Ignat Ignatov and I have been programming since 2021 having expirience with Java, MySql, HTML and CSS, JavaScript, React and Git;

<hr>

ðŸŒ± ->  At the end of my Java web training I developed several small projects with Spring Boot backend and React frontend. Also, in a two-day workshop, we successfully developed a small application with Node.js backend, React frontend and MongoDB databases, where I consolidated knowledge and skills. All of this can be seen on my GitHub profile;

ðŸ”­ ->  I am currently working on an internship project where I gained new skills in Rest Api developing -> Docker, PostgreSql, Flyway and more;

ðŸ‘¯ ->  I am actively seeking my first job opportunity and eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to a dynamic and collaborative team;

âš¡  ->  In 2024 I continue to deepen and expand my knowledge and skills;
